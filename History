The history of Junglebot

Junglebot was created by Kapt3nen/peebob/me 2023-06-17

Originally Junglebot was supposed to be called "Kanyebot" and the only two commands would've been !die and !quote.
!quote was also supposed to originnaly only have Ye tweets and quotes but the "Kanyebot" project was scrapped after i figured out how fangirly it would be
Fun fact, the first 21 quotes in the quote.txt are Kanye tweets or quotes

In the beggining it was very hard to keep JungleBot on the server as the anti-afk pugin kept kicking it. I tried a few methods until i just made him randomly press keys so he would move around and not get kicked.
It was also quite difficult to workaround the anti-spam plugin, eventually i figured out a way but it still sometimes messes up if you try to do the same command many times in a row

Junglebot currently recides in Junglebot's house at spawm
